Prime repository for public website.

### Current Roadmap
Once a good homepage skeleton is set up I intend to add some extra pages with projects.

At the moment I am going for a website which is clean and shows the necessary information about me, with links to my linkedin, github, email, as well as my CV and Academic Transcript.
